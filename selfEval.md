- What did you struggle with in this section?

Mainly what I struggle with on most sections are figuring out how to set up my code, I get flustered. Im going to review lessons from a few days ago and get a better understanding.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

The most helpful note taking ive done has been live during class when we're reviewing. Often when Im on my own with the challenges Im not sure where to start.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

Typically I try on my own first, then Ill go to Google, lastly Ill contact my small group.
